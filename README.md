# HowManybot
HowMany is a simple bot that keeps track of the words that are used in a chat.
It shows a top with the five most used words and the total number of different words that were used so far also allows to look for the amount of times that a word was written.

 TODO:
* Expand list of ignored words
* Programate simple backups
